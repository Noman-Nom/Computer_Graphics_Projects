# Project Proposal: Web-Based 3D Graphics Model Viewer

## Project Information
- **Course Name:** Computer Graphics
- **Course Instructor:** Dr. Muhammad Ghazanfarullah Khan
- **Group Members:**
  - Muhammad Noman (19B-013-CE)
  - Ayesha Usman (20B-038-CE)

## Project Summary
The proposed project aims to develop a web-based 3D Graphics Model Viewer that allows users to upload, view, and manipulate 3D models interactively in a browser environment. Utilizing the PERN stack alongside Three.js, which is a Computer Graphics Library, this application will support various 3D model formats and provide tools for basic transformations and texture editing, targeting designers, hobbyists, and the educational sector.

## Objectives
- To provide a platform where users can easily view and interact with 3D models.
- To enable basic model manipulations such as scaling, rotation, and translation.
- To enhance user engagement through a responsive and intuitive interface.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** ReactJS for UI, Three.js for rendering 3D Graphics models.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for server-side logic.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user and model data, PostgreSQL for transactional data.
- **Other Tools:** Webpack for bundling, Babel for transpiling, and Mongoose for database management.

## Core Features
1. **Model Import and Export:** Support for key 3D formats (OBJ, FBX, STL) with functionality for users to upload from their device and export their work.
2. **Interactive Viewer:** Tools to rotate, zoom, and pan models, implemented via Three.js.
3. **Model Manipulation:** Interface for adjusting model dimensions and applying textures.
4. **User Interface:** A sleek, responsive design optimized for usability and performance.

## Conclusion
This project will leverage modern web technologies to provide a robust and user-friendly environment for 3D model interaction. It is expected to enhance the accessibility of 3D model manipulation, providing a valuable tool for educational and professional use in various fields such as design and engineering.
