## Project Information
- **Course Name:** Computer Graphics
- **Course Instructor:** Dr. Muhammad Ghazanfarullah Khan
- **Group Members:**
  - Sheraz Ahmed (20B-029-CE)
  - Syed Moiz Ali Shah (20B-003-CE)

## 1. Objective:
The objective of the project is to develop an interactive game where players have to guess the correct sequence of colors displayed on the screen. The game challenges players' memory and pattern recognition skills, providing an engaging and entertaining experience.

## 2. Features:
- **User Interface:** Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for the game, including buttons, input fields, and a display area for showing the color sequence.
  
- **Gameplay Mechanics:** Implement core gameplay mechanics, including generating random color sequences, displaying the sequence to the player, and accepting user input for guessing the sequence.
  
- **Scoring System:** Implement a scoring system to track players' performance, including the number of correct guesses, the length of the color sequence, and the time taken to complete each round.
  
- **Difficulty Levels:** Provide multiple difficulty levels to cater to players of different skill levels. Increase the complexity of the color sequences as players progress through the game.
  
- **Sound Effects and Visual Feedback:** Incorporate sound effects and visual feedback to enhance the gaming experience, such as playing sound cues for correct and incorrect guesses and animating the display area to highlight the correct sequence.
  
- **High Scores:** Implement a high score system to record and display the highest scores achieved by players. Allow players to compete with themselves or with other players for the top spot on the leaderboard.

## 3. Implementation:
- **User Interface:** Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface elements for the game, including buttons, input fields, and color display areas. Use CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and event handling.
  
- **Color Generation:** Use JavaScript to generate random color sequences for each round of the game. Define a set of colors to choose from and randomly select a sequence of colors for the player to guess.
  
- **Game Logic:** Implement the core game logic using JavaScript, including displaying the color sequence to the player, accepting user input for guessing the sequence, validating the input, and providing feedback to the player based on their guesses.
  
- **Scoring System:** Implement a scoring system using JavaScript to track players' performance throughout the game. Assign points for each correct guess and penalize incorrect guesses. Update the score display in real-time as the player progresses through the game.
  
- **Difficulty Levels:** Create multiple difficulty levels by adjusting parameters such as the length of the color sequence, the number of colors to choose from, and the time limit for guessing the sequence. Increase the difficulty gradually as players advance through the game.
  
- **Sound Effects and Visual Feedback:** Incorporate sound effects and visual feedback using JavaScript to enhance the gaming experience. Play sound cues for correct and incorrect guesses, and animate the display area to highlight the correct sequence when revealed.
  
- **High Scores:** Implement a high score system using JavaScript and local storage to record and display the highest scores achieved by players. Store the scores locally on the player's device and update the leaderboard accordingly.

## 4. Future Enhancements:
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Add support for multiplayer gameplay, allowing players to compete against each other in real-time.
  
- **Customization Options:** Provide players with customization options, such as choosing their preferred color palette or adjusting game settings like difficulty level and time limit.
  
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Optimize the game for mobile devices by implementing touch controls and responsive design to ensure a seamless gaming experience on smartphones and tablets.
  
- **Social Integration:** Integrate social media features to allow players to share their high scores and achievements with friends on social networks like Facebook and Twitter.
  
- **Additional Game Modes:** Expand the game with additional game modes and challenges, such as timed challenges, survival mode, and endless mode, to keep players engaged and entertained.

## 5. Conclusion:
The Color Sequence Guessing Game is a fun and addictive game that challenges players' memory and pattern recognition skills. By implementing core gameplay mechanics, scoring systems, and difficulty levels, along with sound effects and visual feedback, the game provides an engaging and immersive experience for players of all ages. With future enhancements and continuous improvements, the game has the potential to become a popular choice among casual gamers and puzzle enthusiasts.
